# Introduction
This project was intended to provide an introduction to a complete data science project from start to finish. The initial EDA and modeling was done individually and then groups were formed to enhance the modeling and develop a final product. Only the individual work is shown here.

The Kaggle competition located [here](https://kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) was used.

# Summary
The business problem faced by Home Credit is that people need credit to get credit, and the lack thereof results in higher costs for people who are completely capable of repaying loans. The objective of this model is to develop a method to predict the risk of default of a person without a credit score. This will mean that these potential clients can then be offered loans with lower overall costs that reduced their financial burden and increases the amount of business that Home Credit generates. 

This problem is a supervised classification problem. The target variable is whether a client would have payment difficulties over an initial time period of the loan. The deliverable of this project will be a robust method to integrate the datasets, which can then be used by an algorithm to determine if a specific potential client is predicted to have payment difficulties in the future.

# Challenges and Learnings
The data provided in this analysis was fairly messy and required a large amount of cleaning to be useful. The team found that the cleaning method(s) selected had a large impact on the resulting models' predictive capability. This is not ideal since it makes the analysis more sensitive to the analyst's chosen methods. This meant that the team had to align on a cleaned dataset before comparing our respective models. This is likely true for most real-world projects but was the first time I'd encountered it.
